     -type c
              File is of type c:

              b      block (buffered) special

              c      character (unbuffered) special

              d      directory

              p      named pipe (FIFO)

              f      regular file

              l      symbolic  link;  this  is never true if the -L option or the -follow option is in effect, unless the symbolic link is
                     broken.  If you want to search for symbolic links when -L is in effect, use -xtype.

              To search for more than one type at once, you can supply the combined list of type letters separated by  a  comma  `,'  (GNU
              extension).
